This is the Data Structures and Algorithms Project 3 github page for Caleb Schutz, Gavin Anthony and Ben Pratt

Things that need to get done:
    &emsp;Dijkstra needs to work on app
    &emsp;Setting to allow user to choose two movies to show connections instead of just a graph of one  
    &emsp;Analysis of Dijkstra's versus BFS for Big Oh
    &emsp;Show graph of BFS and Dijkstra on app instead of opening new tab
    &emsp;With selection of movie show cast instead of random numbers
    &emsp; Circle has image of movie instead of dark circle
