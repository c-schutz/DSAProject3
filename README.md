This is the Data Structures and Algorithms Project 3 github page for Caleb Schutz, Gavin Anthony and Ben Pratt

Things that need to get done:
    
    &emsp;Setting to allow user to choose two movies to show connections instead of just a graph of one  
    
    &emsp;Analysis of Dijkstra's versus BFS for Big Oh
    
    &emsp; Show shared actors for BFS and Dijkstra, already done on Normal movie visualizer should be simple
