This is the Data Structures and Algorithms Project 3 github page for Caleb Schutz, Gavin Anthony and Ben Pratt

Things that need to get done:  
    &emsp;Dijkstra's for finding shortest path  
    &emsp;Inputs in the app to choose between duplicates  
    &emsp;Way to choose Dijkstra's versus BFS to find distance  
    &emsp;Setting to allow user to choose two movies instead of just a graph of one  
    &emsp;Analysis of Dijkstra's versus BFS for Big Oh
